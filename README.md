# Nine-Men-s-Morris
Nine Men's Morris created with C++ using SDL2 and OpenGL (and SOIL for image loading).
Nine men's morris is a strategy board game for two players. The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections or points. Each player has nine pieces, or "men", coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'—three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically—allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving them without a legal move.  
The game proceeds in three phases:  
Placing men on vacant points  
Moving men to adjacent points  
(optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men  
The optional phase has not been implemented.
